                <h2>Relation</h2>
                <p>Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States have ranged from military opponents to close allies since 1776. The Thirteen Colonies seceded from the Kingdom of Great Britain and declared independence in 1776, fighting a successful revolutionary war.</p>
                <p>By the 1880s, the US economy had surpassed Britain; in the 1920s, New York City surpassed London as the world's leading
                financial center. The two nations fought Germany together during the two World Wars; since 1940, the two countries have
                been close military allies, enjoying the Special Relationship built as wartime allies and NATO partners.</p>

                <h2>Religion</h2>
                <p>Both the United States and the United Kingdom share the similarity that a majority of their populations state that their
                belief is Christian, at 70.4% in the US[292] and 59.5% in the UK. Also, in both countries the majority of Christian
                followers are members of the mainline Protestant group of churches, rather than the Roman Catholic Church, although the
                Catholic church is relatively sizeable in both countries. Many of these mainline Protestant churches in the United
                States have their origins in the United Kingdom or their founders were British.</p>
                <p>This includes Episcopal (Anglican), Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Quaker.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there are some three big disparities between the two nations in the role of religion and faith. Firstly,
                the United Kingdom has an established church in two of the four nations of the country; the Anglican Church of England,
                where the head of state is the head of the church in one, and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland which plays a notable
                role of the other.</p>

                <h2>Food and drink</h2>
                <p>Many classic dishes or foods from American cuisine such as hamburgers, hot dogs, barbecue chicken, southern fried
                chicken, deep-pan pizza, chewing gum, tomato soup, chilli-con-carne, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate brownies,
                soft-scoop ice cream and donuts are popular in the United Kingdom. Drinks like cola, milkshakes and bourbon are also
                popular. A number of major American food trends and fads have also been popular and influential in the British palate,
                for example weight management diets and craft beer.</p>
                <p>Some British foods have been just as nativised in the US such as apple pie, macaroni and cheese and sandwiches.
                British cuisine was a major influence on the cuisine of the Southern United States, including fried chicken.
                British foods like fish and chips, shepherd's pie, Sunday Roast, Afternoon Tea and gingerbread are also entrenched in
                American food culture. Drinking culture in the US has been heavily influenced by Britain, especially the introduction of
                whisky and certain styles of beer in the colonial period. By the late 20th Century, British cuisine was
                sometimes stereotyped as being unappealing in the United States, although British cuisine is commonly eaten there.
                This reputation has been attributed to the impact that WWII rationing had on British cuisine in the mid-20th Century.</p>

                <h2>Culture and media</h2>
                <p>Both the US and UK are considered cultural superpowers; both countries having a large scale influence around the world
                in film, music, literature, and television.</p>
                <p>n media, connections between the US and the UK in print media are minor but strong in online content. Until 2016, a
                condensed version of The New York Times was inside The Observer newspaper. In some newsagents in the UK, people can find
                international editions of USA Today, The New York Times International Edition, the Europe edition of Time,
                Newsweek, The New Yorker, New York magazine and Foreign Affairs. While in the US you would be able to find the
                international edition of The Economist and in New York City, the Financial Times. After Rupert Murdoch's purchase of the
                New York Post in November 1976, he redesigned the newspaper into a populist right-wing tabloid, likewise his
                earlier relaunch of the British Sun newspaper as a down-market tabloid from 1969.</p>

                <h2>Film</h2>
                <p>There is much crossover appeal in the modern entertainment culture of the United Kingdom and the United States. For
                example, Hollywood blockbuster movies made by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have had a large effect on British
                audiences in the United Kingdom, while the James Bond and Harry Potter series of films have attracted high interest in
                the United States.</p>
                <p>Also, the animated films of Walt Disney as well as those of Pixar, DreamWorks, Don Bluth, Blue Sky, Illumination and
                others have continued to make an indelible mark and impression on British audiences, young and old, for almost 100
                years. Films by Alfred Hitchcock continuously make a lasting impact on a loyal fan base in the United States, as Alfred
                Hitchcock himself influenced notable American filmmakers such as John Carpenter, in the horror and slasher film genres.</p>
                <p>Production of films are often shared between the two nations, whether it be a concentrated use of British and American
                actors or the use of film studios located in London or Hollywood.</p>
