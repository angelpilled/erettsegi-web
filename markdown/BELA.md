# School Project Overview
This text contains all the necessary information regarding this project. Was generated via GPT-4. Thanks.

## 1. Web Design
Even though the web part might not be super important, you'll want a user-friendly interface to showcase your information. 
* **Homepage**: 
  - A brief introduction about your project.
* **Subjects Page**: 
  - List all the five subjects, with links to detailed pages.
* **Detail Page for each Subject**: 
  - A brief introduction, followed by the topic details, resources, and perhaps some interactive elements if possible.

## 2. Calculus
Considering you don't have much experience with calculus, I'll give you a basic overview.

### Introduction to Calculus
* **Definition**: 
  - A branch of mathematics that studies continuous change, via derivatives and integrals.
* **History**: 
  - Mention famous mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

### Main Concepts
* **Derivative**: 
  - Measures how a function changes as its input changes. For example, the slope of a line tangent to a curve at any point.
* **Integral**: 
  - Measures the area underneath a curve. It can be thought of as the "opposite" of a derivative.

### Applications
* Physics: 
  - Motion and waves.
* Economics: 
  - Maximizing profit, marginal cost.
* Biology: 
  - Modeling populations, spread of diseases.

## 3. Kernel Programming

### Introduction to Kernel Programming
* **Definition**: 
  - The kernel is the central or most essential part of an operating system that manages operations of the computer and the hardware.
  
### Main Concepts
* **Monolithic vs. Microkernels**: 
  - Monolithic kernels have all OS services in the same address space, while microkernels run more processes in user space.
* **System Calls**: 
  - Interfaces through which user-space applications can request services of the kernel.

### Applications
* Custom operating systems.
* Performance optimization.
* Embedded systems and IoT devices.

## Plan of Action
1. **Research & Write Content**: Start with Calculus since it's the most unfamiliar. Use online resources, books, or videos to understand and then write content for the website.
2. **Web Design**: Choose a web platform and start designing the basic structure.
3. **Add Content to Web**: As you complete your content for each subject, add it to the respective pages on the website.
4. **Interactive Elements**: If possible, include quizzes, animations, or diagrams to make the website more engaging.
5. **Review with your partner**: Regularly review your progress with your partner, and ensure that your combined content flows well together.
6. **Final Touches**: Once all content is uploaded, focus on the design. Make sure the website is easy to navigate, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive (looks good on both desktop and mobile).
7. **Proofread**: Always proofread! Check for grammatical errors and make sure all links are working.
